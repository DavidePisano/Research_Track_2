Research_Track_2: Assignment 1
================================

Research Track 2: First part
------------------------------------

The delivery of the first part of the assignment was to add documentation to the second assignment of Research Track I.
Having done the code with python I decided to use Sphinx to do the documentation.
The project documentation is at the following link: [Documentazione](https://davidepisano.github.io/Research_Track_2/).

Research Track 2: Second Assignment 
------------------------------------

The secondpart og the assignment was always to start from the second assignment of RT1 and replace the user interface of node A with a jupyter notebook. In the notebook that I implemented there are:
- some buttons for managing the movement of the robot in the environment.
- a graph for the number of achieved/not achieved goals.
- a graph with the position of the robot and the positions of the targets in the environment.
- the laser scanner which plots the distance to the closest obstacle.

Research Track 2: Third part 
------------------------------------

The third and final part of the first RT1 assignment consisted in drafting a statistical report regarding the first RT1 assignment. The report is made up of:
- Introduction of the statistical analysis done.
- Hypotheses made (null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis).
- Description and motivation of the experimental setup (types of experiments, number of repetitions)
- Results and discussion with statistical analysis.
- Conclusion (is the hypothesis proven?).
