==================

Research Track 2: First Assignment 
------------------------------------

The delivery of the first assignment was to add documentation to the second assignment of Research Track I.
Having done the assignment with python I decided to use Sphinx to do the documentation.
The project documentation is at the following link: [Documentazione](https://davidepisano.github.io/Research_Track_2/).

Research Track 2: Second Assignment 
------------------------------------

The second assignment was to always start from the second assignment of RT1 and replace the user interface of node A with a jupyter notebook. In the notebook that I implemented there are:
- some buttons for managing the movement of the robot in the environment
- a graph with the position of the robot and the positions of the targets in the environment
- the laser scanner which plots the distance to the closest obstacle
- A graph for the number of achieved/not achieved goals
